# Reflection 

## My development process, Challenges faced, how I overcame them, feature not implmented

The development process invovled  creating an html file with input fields to create a blog post.
I then perform event handling using the submit button to add the blog post to the list.
I didn't really have time to finish the event handlerfor the edit button.
I found it difficult to finish this assignment  since it was repeating alot of what we've already done before.
The other thing is I felt kind of burned out, I started the assignment multiple times, but couldn't start it until much later.
